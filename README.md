## Playing the game

The player starts his perilous journey on the grass, facing 4 rows of bugs. 

Try to get him through the rows of insects to the water. The player will get returned to the start if he touches any part of the bugs.

Use your keyboard arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move your player up the screen. 

Once you reach the water, you win.
